We have a lot of methods to control servo motors using Raspberry Pi Microcomputers.


a. The Normal and pwm.ChangeDutyCycle() method [RPi.GPIO Library]

b. The Efficient and smart Library of "RpiMotorLib", Installation Procedure

sudo pip install rpimotorlib

For details go through the link provided. It has sweep, move & step function

3. The Third one is the [Pigpio Library]

Instructions for Execution: https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/RpiMotorLib/blob/master/Documentation/Servo_pigpio.md


IMPORTANT PRACTICAL ANALYSIS BY Gavin Lyons Repo (Tested & Verified):

There are two different options for controlling the servo.

* When using Rpi_GPIO option you may notice twitching at certain delays and stepsizes. This is the result of the implementation of the RPIO PWM software timing.


* If the application requires precise control the user can pick the pigpio library which uses hardware based timing. The disadvantage being they must install another dependency
